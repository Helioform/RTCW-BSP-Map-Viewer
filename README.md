# RTCW-BSP-Map-Viewer
Loads and renders Return To Castle Wolfenstein maps.

Displays BSP maps with lightmaps as well as load and parse shaders.

Requires:

  * Visual Studio 2017
  
  * DirectX 10 and 11 headers and libs
  
  * Main Return To Castle Wolfenstein bsp maps and textures (placed in WorldMaps folder)
  
  * Graphics Card with Direct3D 10 GPU
  
  * Windows 7/10 (has not been tested on previous versions of Windows)
  
  I am thinking about converting this project to a simple FPS game using Quake 3 tools. For now you can move around using A/W/S/D keys and the mouse. Give around 15-20 seconds for shader loading/parsing and loading the map, depending on the map. I might upload a single map and some textures, if someone doesn't have the RTCW game.
  
  TODO:
  
  * Display Bezier Patches
  * Render fog using Direct3D shaders 
  * Collision detection with brushes
  * Render Basic Quake 3 shaders
